  <hr>

  <p class="small-text">NHS Penalty Charge Notices are issued in accordance with the NHS (Penalty Charge) Regulations 1999. The NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) works on behalf of the NHS to check claims for free prescriptions and recover charges from patients who incorrectly claim they do not have to pay. This is done to protect public funds and provide best value for money for the taxpayer. </p>
